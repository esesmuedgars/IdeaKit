## Enhanced programming

### WWDC 2021 highlights

Apple Worldwide Developers Conference has concluded. Aftermath, [Apple](https://twitter.com/apple) provides [selection of documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/New-Technologies-WWDC-2021) for new technologies, frameworks, and APIs introduced at WWDC 2021.

### `DocC` documentation in Xcode

Discover how you can use DocC to build and share documentation for Swift packages and frameworks. We'll show you how to begin generating documentation from your own code ‚Äî or from third-party code you depend upon ‚Äî and write and format it using Markdown. And we'll also take you through the export process, helping you generate DocC archives to share with the public.
[Apple](https://twitter.com/apple) announced [DocC](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/docc) framework, watch WWDC21 session [video](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10166) by [Victoria Mitchell](<!--Couldn't find Victoria Mitchell's single social media account-->) and [Ethan Kusters](https://twitter.com/ethankusters)

[article](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/238/how-to-document-your-project-with-docc) by [Paul Hudson](https://twitter.com/twostraws)

A tutorial expands your Swift framework or package‚Äôs reference documentation with interactive educational content. Create a tutorial by adding a table of contents and individual tutorial pages that walk the reader through coding exercises that teach your APIs.

### Swift concurrency

#### Meet `async`/`await` in Swift

Swift now supports asynchronous functions ‚Äî a pattern commonly known as async/await. Discover how the new syntax can make your code easier to read and understand. Learn what happens when a function suspends, and find out how to adapt existing completion handlers to asynchronous functions.
[Apple](https://twitter.com/apple) WWDC21 session [video](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10132) by [Nate Chandler](https://twitter.com/neightchan) and [Robert Widmann](https://twitter.com/CodaFi_)

#### Protect mutable state with Swift actors

Data races occur when two separate threads concurrently access the same mutable state. They are trivial to construct, but are notoriously hard to debug. Discover how you can stop these data races in their tracks with Swift actors, which help synchronize access to data in your code. Discover how actors work and how to share values between them. Learn about how actor isolation affects protocol conformances. And finally, meet the main actor, a new way of ensuring that your code always runs on the main thread when needed. To get the most out of this session, we recommend first watching [_Meet async/await in Swift_](#meet-asyncawait-in-swift).

#### Explore structured concurrency in Swift

When you have code that needs to run at the same time as other code, it's important to choose the right tool for the job. We'll take you through the different kinds of concurrent tasks you can create in Swift, show you how to create groups of tasks, and find out how to cancel tasks in progress. We'll also provide guidance on when you may want to use unstructured tasks. To get the most out of this session, we first recommend watching [_Meet async/await in Swift_](#meet-asyncawait-in-swift).

#### Behind the scenes of Swift concurrency

Dive into the details of Swift concurrency and discover how Swift provides greater safety from data races and thread explosion while simultaneously improving performance. We'll explore how Swift tasks differ from Grand Central Dispatch, how the new cooperative threading model works, and how to ensure the best performance for your apps. To get the most out of this session, we recommend first watching [_Meet async/await in Swift_](#meet-asyncawait-in-swift), [_Explore structured concurrency in Swift_](#explore-structured-concurrency-in-swift), and [_Protect mutable state with Swift actors_](#protect-mutable-state-with-swift-actors).

That, and much more, on this WWDC21 special episode of the show.
[Swift by Sundell](https://twitter.com/swiftbysundell) [John Sundell](https://twitter.com/johnsundell) [podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/lv/podcast/swift-by-sundell/id1267161825?i=1000525108228) with special guest [Doug Gregor](https://twitter.com/dgregor79)

### Data formatters to display human-friendly content

Convert data into readable strings or Swift objects using formatters.
[Apple](https://twitter.com/apple) has a [sample code](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/formatter/displaying_human-friendly_content)

Save yourself time and frustration: When you display data in your app ‚Äî including dates, times, measurements, names, lists, numbers, or strings ‚Äî learn how to format it correctly and provide a great experience. We'll walk you through the Formatter APIs as well as how SwiftUI works with stringsdict, and show you how they can help do the heavy lifting of formatting data. Learn about best practices and how to avoid common mistakes.

### Application capabilities

A capability grants the application access to an app service provided by Apple, such as iCloud, HealthKit, In-App Purchase, or push notifications. [Apple](https://twitter.com/apple) in an [article](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode/adding-capabilities-to-your-app) guide you through the process of adding application capabilities.

### Sign in with Apple user authentication 

Have you ever abbandoned the idea of trying out new application after realising sign-up is mandatory? I believe it's safe to claim that the majority of user's value their privacy, I've never felt comfortable in linking account to Google or Facebook and at the same time I do not wish to uneccessary expose my e-mail address. [Sign in with Apple](https://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple) grants user's a choice to keep their e-mail address private. [Apple](https://twitter.com/apple) provides a [sample code](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/implementing_user_authentication_with_sign_in_with_apple) on how to use [Authentication Services](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices) framework to provide users an interface to set up account and authenticates the user‚Äôs Apple ID with Sign in with Apple.

### Kotlin Multiplatform for iOS developers

Starting the 18<sup>th</sup> of February 2021 in Latvia ATC there have occured multiple _BrownBag_ sessions lead by [Mykhailo Dontsov](https://people.accenture.com/People/user/mykhailo.dontsov) and [Aleksejs Frolovs](https://people.accenture.com/People/user/aleksejs.frolovs) on the topic of [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/lp/mobile). Kotlin Multiplatform enables you to use a single codebase for the business logic of multiple applications. At the same time, native user interfaces can be written in a platform-specific language. [Dinorah Tovar](https://twitter.com/DDinorahtovar) in her [presentation](https://vimeo.com/showcase/7769418/video/479639284) talks about how to get started with Kotlin Multiplatform for iOS.

### Scan and verify identity documents with `Core NFC`

Using [Core NFC](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corenfc) framework you can detect Near Field Communication (NFC) tags and read messages that contain NFC Data Exchange Format (NDEF) data. [Maxim Tsvetkov](https://twitter.com/777maxxx777) gave a [presentation](https://vimeo.com/showcase/7769418/video/479350475) on what tool are available out-of-the-box, what data can be extracted, and how to verify document authenticity. 

### Data formatting in iOS 15

Up until recently, in order to format data we were creating and configuring different formatter classes, which are expensive operations (e.g., [Sarun Wongpatcharapakornand](https://twitter.com/sarunw) has an [article](https://sarunw.com/posts/how-expensive-is-dateformatter) where he provides statistics on the cost of `DateFormatter` creation and property mutation). Hopefully, that will be tthe thing of the past wiith the introduuction of new formatting API. Read [article](https://nemecek.be/blog/106/new-approach-to-formatters-in-ios-15) by [Filip Nƒõmeƒçek](https://twitter.com/nemecek_f).

### `UISheetPresentationController`

iOS 15 adds means to present view controller as a sheet. In an [article](https://nemecek.be/blog/108/meet-the-new-bottom-sheet-in-ios-15) [Filip Nƒõmeƒçek](https://twitter.com/nemecek_f)
describes resizable sheet implementation and customization.
