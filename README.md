## Swift challenge

Few possible solutions to Swift challenge No. 1:

```swift
// MARK: Solution A

private func spellOut() -> String {
    switch self {
    case 0: return "Zero"
    case 1: return "One"
    case 2: return "Two"
    case 3: return "Three"
    case 4: return "Four"
    case 5: return "Five"
    case 6: return "Six"
    case 7: return "Seven"
    case 8: return "Eight"
    case 9: return "Nine"
    default: return String()
    }
}

// MARK: Solution B

private func spellOut() -> String {
    let spelledOutNumbers = ["Zero",
                             "One",
                             "Two",
                             "Three",
                             "Four",
                             "Five",
                             "Six",
                             "Seven",
                             "Eight",
                             "Nine"]

    return spelledOutNumbers[self]
}

// MARK: Solution C

private func spellOut() -> String {
    let numberFormatter = NumberFormatter()
    numberFormatter.numberStyle = .spellOut

    guard let number = numberFormatter.string(from: NSNumber(value: self)) else {
        return String()
    }

    return number.capitalized
}

// MARK: Solution D

private func spellOut() -> String {
    let number = NumberFormatter.localizedString(from: NSNumber(value: self), number: .spellOut)

    return number.capitalized
}
```

Followed by Swift challenge No. 2:

```swift
/**
Survey if the file at path exists or not.
Implement `checkIfFileExists(_:)` method.
 */

func checkIfFileExists(_ fileURL: URL) -> Bool {
    <#Bool#>
}
```

<!--
If you are unsure if the URL exists or not before opening it, just go ahead and open it as checking first will duplicate the amount of work the file system needs to perform.
However, if you do not need to open the file but verify if it exists using URL's check resource is reachable will work for the vast majority of URLs and is recommended over getting a file system path and then checking with the file manager if the file exists.

```swift
func checkIfFileExists(_ fileURL: URL) -> Bool {
    <#Bool#>
}
```
-->

## Fundamentals

### A pragmatic guide to unit testing

Unit testing facilitates changes and simplifies integration. In addition to giving confidence when refactoring code by confirming module works after introduced changes, executing tests before every commit saves you from accidentally committing a version that doesnâ€™t compile. [Marina Gornostaeva](https://twitter.com/hybridcattt) in her [article](https://hybridcattt.com/blog/start-testing-pragmatic-guide) covers how to configure the project for testing, differentiate between different kinds of tests, and approach seemingly untestable code.

Additionally, a hilarious remark [Marcin Krzyzanowski](https://twitter.com/krzyzanowskim) made in his Twitter [post](https://twitter.com/krzyzanowskim/status/1410320595221463044) made me laugh, check it out!

### `DocC` archived and analyzed

[Helge HeÃŸ](https://twitter.com/helje5) wrote an [article](http://www.alwaysrightinstitute.com/docz) about his investigation of `DocC` produced documentation archive. He found that the `DocC` archive doesn't only contain a version of the documentation suitable for the Xcode Documentation Viewer but also generated documentation as raw, parseable data, in a hierarchy of JSON files and images.

### Swift Package Index

Selecting the proper dependencies is about more than just finding code that does what you need. Are the libraries you are choosing well maintained? How long have they been in development? Are they well tested? Picking high-quality packages is challenging, and the [Swift Package Index](https://swiftpackageindex.com) (a search engine for packages that support the Swift Package Manager) helps you make better decisions about your dependencies.

### Benchmarking Swift code with Attabench framework and GUI macOS application

If you too have been benchmarking the speed of code by adding multiple timestamps using `Date` object and calculating the time difference, [Bruno Rocha](https://twitter.com/rockbruno_) in his [article](https://swiftrocks.com/benchmarking-swift-code-properly-with-attabench) suggests using the [Attabench](https://github.com/attaswift/Attabench) framework that is accompanied by a GUI macOS application for microbenchmarking. The tool compiles your application in the release configuration and repeatedly performs the same operation on random data of various sizes, while continuously charting the results which makes it ideal for seeing your algorithm's performance at a glance.

## Tips

### Manually adding existing certificates to the fastlane match

Fastlane match stores certificates, private keys, and provisioning profiles in a separate git repository, Google Cloud, or Amazon S3 to sync them across your development team. Sharing a single code signing identity simplifies code signing setup and prevents code signing issues. [Sarun Wongpatcharapakornand](https://twitter.com/sarunw) in his [article](https://sarunw.com/posts/how-to-manually-add-existing-certificates-to-fastlane-match) takes us through how to import an existing certificate into the match repository.

### File extensions in Xcode

[Douglas Hill](https://twitter.com/qdoug) in his Twitter [post](https://twitter.com/qdoug/status/1411948641292521478) demonstrates that in Xcode 13 developers can hide inferable file extensions.

### Making debugger console output stand out

[Dominik Hauser](https://twitter.com/dasdom) in his [article](https://dasdom.dev/posts/changing-color-for-debugger-output) demonstrates how to make debugger console output easier to find by customizing its color.

### Avoiding retain cycles in `Combine`

[Eneko Alonso](https://twitter.com/eneko) in his Twitter [post](https://twitter.com/eneko/status/1416143468070465537) shares an example of the retain cycle remedy while working with `Combine` or any other escaping closure.

### When should you use a throwing initializer?

When constructing an object using a failable initializer, the result is an optional that either contains the object (when the initialization succeeded) or contains `nil` (when the initialization failed). [Vincent Pradeilles](https://twitter.com/v_pradeilles) in his YouTube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWWj8zgd--c) briefs that throwing initializer can be used to convey failure information.

### Assert xib files exist

In case a project you are working on relies a lot on xib files, [Vincent Pradeilles](https://twitter.com/v_pradeilles) in his YouTube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qowbAhsDuO0) encourages you to implement tests that validate xib file for the specified class is in the bundle.
