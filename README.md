# Non-fungible token

###### 4 minute read

Recent activity around NFT climaxed with all-time high media coverage and search volume. First purely digital artwork ever offered by a major auction house - Christie’s on the 11th of March sold "[Everydays - The First 5000 Days](https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/beeple-first-5000-days/beeple-b-1981-1/112924)" non-fungible token by [Beeple](https://twitter.com/beeple) for over $69 million. If you have managed to avoid the topic thus far it is about to change, let’s better understand the nuances of NFT.

## What does NFT abbreviation mean?

Non-fungible token.

## What is a non-fungible token?

A non-fungible token is a unit of data on a blockchain (if you’re not familiar with the basic concept of a blockchain I invite you to complete the [TQ Blockchain course](https://app.pluralsight.com/partner-cr/accenture/summary/cr-tq-blockchain)). Where each NFT represents a unique digital asset. Examples include collectibles, game items, digital art, event tickets, domain names, audios, videos, articles, tweets, and even ownership records for physical assets.

Non-fungible means not interchangeable. The majority of your belonging are non-fungible. Those are not replaceable by another identical item. A currency is a classic example of a fungible asset. Five dollars is always five dollars no matter the serial number on the specific five-dollar bill, or whether it’s five dollars sitting in your bank account. The ability to replace a five-dollar bill with another five-dollar bill (or five ones, for that matter) is what makes currency fungible.

## What do NFTs bring to the table?

Just as we had digital currencies (think loyalty points, in-game currencies) before cryptocurrencies emerged, we’ve had non-fungible digital assets since the dawn of the internet. Domain names, event tickets, in-game items, even handles on social networks like Instagram and Facebook, are all non-fungible digital assets. However, we own these assets in specific contexts, which may or may not make trading them easy.

This is where blockchains come in! Blockchains provide a coordination layer for digital assets, giving users ownership and management permission. Blockchains add several unique properties to non-fungible assets:

- Standardization (by representing non-fungible tokens on public blockchains, developers can build common, reusable, inheritable standards relevant to all non-fungible tokens);
 - Interoperability (open standards by providing a consistent, reliable, and permissioned API for reading and writing of data allow easy movement of non-fungible tokens across multiple ecosystems);
- Tradability;
- Liquidity;
- Indivisibility (non-fungible tokens exist exclusively as a whole item and cannot be divided into smaller denominations like cryptocurrencies);
- Immutability and verifiable scarcity (smart contracts enable developers to place hard caps on the supply of non-fungible tokens and enforce persistent properties that cannot be modified after the non-fungible tokens are issued);
- Programmability.

## How do NFTs work?

A non-fungible token is created by uploading a file, such as an artwork, to a non-fungible token marketplace and minting it (putting a digital object on the blockchain as a token for the first time). This creates a copy of the file recorded on the digital ledger as a non-fungible token, which can be bought with cryptocurrency and resold.

Actual digital assets are not encoded into the blockchain (as, with current storage limitations, that would be too expensive), instead, in most cases, JSON metadata is stored off-chain, either by using a centralized server or a cloud storage solution (e.g. Amazon Web Services) or [InterPlanetary File System](https://ipfs.io) (peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system), and referenced from the blockchain. IPFS ensures that the metadata is immutable, as it is uniquely addressed by the hash of the file and as long as there are nodes willing to host the data, the data will persist over time. Off-chain storage does not ensure that files remain available.

## With digital art, a copy is literally as good as the original

Non-fungible tokens are designed to give you something that can’t be copied: ownership of the work (though the artist can still retain the copyright and reproduction rights, just like with physical artwork). To put it in terms of physical art collecting: anyone can purchase a Basquiat print. But the original can only have a single owner.
