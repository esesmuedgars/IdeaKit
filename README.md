## Tutorials

### Firebase Dynamic Links

[Danijela Vrzan](https://twitter.com/dvrzan) in her [tutorial](https://www.raywenderlich.com/21376846-firebase-dynamic-links-getting-started) teaches how to implement deep linking on iOS using Firebase Dynamic Links. By the end of the tutorial you will be able to create, test, handle deep links if the application is not installed, and navigate to a specific view with `SwiftUI`.

### `DocC` documentation in Xcode

Discover how you can use DocC to build and share documentation for Swift packages and frameworks. We'll show you how to begin generating documentation from your own code ‚Äî or from third-party code you depend upon ‚Äî and write and format it using Markdown. And we'll also take you through the export process, helping you generate DocC archives to share with the public.

[article](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/238/how-to-document-your-project-with-docc) by [Paul Hudson](https://twitter.com/twostraws)

A tutorial expands your Swift framework or package‚Äôs reference documentation with interactive educational content. Create a tutorial by adding a table of contents and individual tutorial pages that walk the reader through coding exercises that teach your APIs.

### Streamline your localized strings

When you localize the text within your app, you can help make your app more accessible to a worldwide audience. Discover best practices for building your localization workflow, including how to write and format strings accurately, and learn how to prepare strings for localization in different languages using Xcode.

### Automatic Reference Counting in Swift

Learn about the basics of object lifetimes and ARC in Swift. Dive deep into what language features make object lifetimes observable, consequences of relying on observed object lifetimes and some safe techniques to fix them.

### Swift concurrency

#### Meet `async`/`await` in Swift

Swift now supports asynchronous functions ‚Äî a pattern commonly known as async/await. Discover how the new syntax can make your code easier to read and understand. Learn what happens when a function suspends, and find out how to adapt existing completion handlers to asynchronous functions.

#### Protect mutable state with Swift actors

Data races occur when two separate threads concurrently access the same mutable state. They are trivial to construct, but are notoriously hard to debug. Discover how you can stop these data races in their tracks with Swift actors, which help synchronize access to data in your code. Discover how actors work and how to share values between them. Learn about how actor isolation affects protocol conformances. And finally, meet the main actor, a new way of ensuring that your code always runs on the main thread when needed. To get the most out of this session, we recommend first watching [_Meet async/await in Swift_](#meet-asyncawait-in-swift).

#### Explore structured concurrency in Swift

When you have code that needs to run at the same time as other code, it's important to choose the right tool for the job. We'll take you through the different kinds of concurrent tasks you can create in Swift, show you how to create groups of tasks, and find out how to cancel tasks in progress. We'll also provide guidance on when you may want to use unstructured tasks. To get the most out of this session, we first recommend watching [_Meet async/await in Swift_](#meet-asyncawait-in-swift).

#### Swift concurrency in action

Discover Swift concurrency in action: Follow along as we update an existing sample app. Get real-world experience with async/await, actors, and continuations. We'll also explore techniques for migrating existing code to Swift concurrency over time. To get the most out of this code-along, we recommend first watching [_Meet async/await in Swift_](#meet-asyncawait-in-swift) and [_Protect mutable state with Swift actors_](#protect-mutable-state-with-swift-actors).

#### Behind the scenes of Swift concurrency

Dive into the details of Swift concurrency and discover how Swift provides greater safety from data races and thread explosion while simultaneously improving performance. We'll explore how Swift tasks differ from Grand Central Dispatch, how the new cooperative threading model works, and how to ensure the best performance for your apps. To get the most out of this session, we recommend first watching [_Meet async/await in Swift_](#meet-asyncawait-in-swift), [_Explore structured concurrency in Swift_](#explore-structured-concurrency-in-swift), and [_Protect mutable state with Swift actors_](#protect-mutable-state-with-swift-actors).

#### Structured concurrency

Doug Gregor from Apple joins John to discuss Swift 5.5‚Äôs new concurrency features in great detail. How do features like async/await and actors work under the hood, and how were those concepts adapted in order to feel right at home within Swift‚Äôs existing ecosystem? That, and much more, on this WWDC21 special episode of the show.

### Data formatters to display human-friendly content

Convert data into readable strings or Swift objects using formatters.
[Apple](https://twitter.com/apple) has a [sample code](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/formatter/displaying_human-friendly_content)

Save yourself time and frustration: When you display data in your app ‚Äî including dates, times, measurements, names, lists, numbers, or strings ‚Äî learn how to format it correctly and provide a great experience. We'll walk you through the Formatter APIs as well as how SwiftUI works with stringsdict, and show you how they can help do the heavy lifting of formatting data. Learn about best practices and how to avoid common mistakes.
