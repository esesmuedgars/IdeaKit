[Paul Hudson](https://twitter.com/twostraws) in his [article](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/233/whats-new-in-swift-5-5) offers [code samples](https://www.whatsnewinswift.com/?from=5.4&to=5.5) of all of the main changes.

### App Store Review Guideline updates

"Apps supporting account creation must also offer account deletion" and other additions to the App Store Review Guidelines you can get familiar with in [Apple's](https://twitter.com/apple) news [article](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=dovxb62h).

## Fundamentals

### `class` and `struct`

In case I was your _TechBuddy_ (also known as a technical mentor) during your iOS internship you most likely have received feedback to use structures instead of classes for data models when decoding HTTP responses. [Pedro Rojas](https://twitter.com/pitt500) in his YouTube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOeC7pxOIhk) compares both of them and points out the differences.
Additionally, [Sean Allen](https://twitter.com/seanallen_dev) offers YouTube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhDML-fAqTM) explaining classes and YouTube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ox38NBBiNM) explaining structures.

### Tips to improve your Swift code

In his YouTube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TTSZZkdOs4), [Vincent Pradeilles](https://twitter.com/v_pradeilles) advises increasing the quality of your Swift code. It is also recommended that you refer to any Swift style guide (e.g., Airbnb Swift [style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/swift), LinkedIn Swift [style guide](https://github.com/linkedin/swift-style-guide), raywenderlich.com Swift [style guide](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide), or Google Swift [style guide](https://google.github.io/swift)) to have a clear, consistent, and precise codebase.

### Debugging with breakpoints

Breakpoints are locations in your source code where the Xcode debugger will pause so that you can inspect the state of your program and step through your code to pinpoint the root cause of an issue or isolate a bug. [Sean Allen](https://twitter.com/seanallen_dev) in his YouTube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPWfOkHcKdU) exhibits how to debug an application with the help of breakpoints.

### `UINavigationController`

Watch a YouTube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbAd2FIlnos) by [Sean Allen](https://twitter.com/seanallen_dev) where he explains what navigation controllers are, how do they work, and how to customize a navigation controller to match your application's look and feel.

### Higher-order functions

[Manish Jain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manish-jain-b5911620) wrote a short [article](https://medium.com/xebia-engineering/higher-order-functions-in-swift-c2f823f970fe) educating about some of the most common higher-order functions such as `map(_:)`, `filter(_:)`, and `contains(_:)`.

## Tutorials

#### Protect mutable state with Swift actors

Data races occur when two separate threads concurrently access the same mutable state. In [Apple's](https://twitter.com/apple) WWDC21 [session](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10133) (to get the most out of the session, they first recommend watching [_Meet `async`/`await` in Swift_](#meet-asyncawait-in-swift)) [Dario Rexin](https://twitter.com/evonox) and [Doug Gregor](https://twitter.com/dgregor79) instruct how to synchronize access to data and prevent data races with Swift actors. Learn how actors work, how to share values between 'em, as well as how actor isolation affects protocol conformances.

#### Explore structured concurrency in Swift

Watch WWDC21 [session](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10134) (to get the most out of the session, it is recommended first watching [_Meet `async`/`await` in Swift_](#meet-asyncawait-in-swift)) by [Apple](https://twitter.com/apple) where [Kavon Farvardin](https://twitter.com/call1cc) and [Joe Groff](https://twitter.com/jckarter) take you through the different kinds of concurrent tasks developers can create in Swift, show how to create groups of tasks, and share how to cancel running tasks.

#### Swift concurrency in action

Follow along and obtain real-world experience with `async`/`await`, actors, and continuations as [Ben Cohen](https://twitter.com/AirspeedSwift) updates an existing sample application in WWDC21 [session](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10194) (it is recommended viewing [_Meet `async`/`await` in Swift_](#meet-asyncawait-in-swift) and [_Protect mutable state with Swift actors_](#protect-mutable-state-with-swift-actors) before participating in this code-along) by [Apple](https://twitter.com/apple).

Listen to their conversation about inner-workings of asynchronous functions and Swift actors in an [episode](https://podcasts.apple.com/lv/podcast/swift-by-sundell/id1267161825?i=1000525108228).

### Application capabilities

A capability grants the application access to an app service provided by Apple, such as iCloud, HealthKit, In-App Purchase, or push notifications. [Apple](https://twitter.com/apple) in an [article](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode/adding-capabilities-to-your-app) guides you through the process of adding application capabilities.

### Sign in with Apple user authentication 

Have you ever abandoned the idea of trying out a new application after realizing sign-up is mandatory? I believe it's safe to claim that the majority of users value their privacy, I've never felt comfortable in linking my account to Google or Facebook, and at the same time, I do not wish to unnecessarily expose my e-mail address. [Sign in with Apple](https://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple) grants user's a choice to keep their e-mail address private. [Apple](https://twitter.com/apple) provides a [sample code](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/implementing_user_authentication_with_sign_in_with_apple) on how to use the [Authentication Services](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices) framework to provide users an interface to set up an account and authenticates the user‚Äôs Apple ID with Sign in with Apple.

### Kotlin Multiplatform for iOS developers

Starting the 18<sup>th</sup> of February 2021 in Latvia ATC there have occurred multiple _BrownBag_ sessions lead by [Mykhailo Dontsov](https://people.accenture.com/People/user/mykhailo.dontsov) and [Aleksejs Frolovs](https://people.accenture.com/People/user/aleksejs.frolovs) on the topic of [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/lp/mobile). Kotlin Multiplatform enables you to use a single codebase for the business logic of multiple applications. At the same time, native user interfaces can be written in a platform-specific language. [Dinorah Tovar](https://twitter.com/DDinorahtovar) in her [presentation](https://vimeo.com/showcase/7769418/video/479639284) talks about how to get started with Kotlin Multiplatform for iOS.

### Scan and verify identity documents with `Core NFC`

Using the [Core NFC](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corenfc) framework you can detect Near Field Communication (NFC) tags and read messages that contain NFC Data Exchange Format (NDEF) data. [Maxim Tsvetkov](https://twitter.com/777maxxx777) gave a [presentation](https://vimeo.com/showcase/7769418/video/479350475) on what tools are available out-of-the-box, what data can be extracted, and how to verify document authenticity.

### Data formatters to display human-friendly content

Learn about the best practices of converting data into readable strings or Swift objects and how to avoid common mistakes using formatters in [Apple's](https://twitter.com/apple) [sample code](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/formatter/displaying_human-friendly_content) (sample code is associated with WWDC20 [session](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10160) where [Karan Mi≈õra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karanmisra) walks viewers through the formatter APIs as well as how `SwiftUI` works with `.stringsdict` files.
Further, learn about modern formatter API in [_Data formatting in iOS 15_](#data-formatting-in-ios-15).

### Data formatting in iOS 15

Up until recently, to format data we were creating and configuring different formatter classes (highlighted in [_Data formatters to display human-friendly content_](#data-formatters-to-display-human-friendly-content)), which are expensive operations (e.g., [Sarun Wongpatcharapakornand](https://twitter.com/sarunw) has an [article](https://sarunw.com/posts/how-expensive-is-dateformatter) where he provides statistics on the cost of `DateFormatter` creation and property mutation). Hopefully, that will be the thing of the past with the introduction of a new formatter API. Read [article](https://nemecek.be/blog/106/new-approach-to-formatters-in-ios-15) by [Filip Nƒõmeƒçek](https://twitter.com/nemecek_f).

### `UISheetPresentationController`

iOS 15 adds the means to present the view controller as a sheet. In an [article](https://nemecek.be/blog/108/meet-the-new-bottom-sheet-in-ios-15), [Filip Nƒõmeƒçek](https://twitter.com/nemecek_f) describes resizable sheet implementation and customization.

### iOS 15 `UIButton` configuration API

iOS 15 enhances how we configure `UIButton` appearance and behavior with a new API that takes many common and previously time-consuming layout and styling tasks and turns them into one-line configuration properties. [John Sundell](https://twitter.com/johnsundell) in his [article](https://wwdcbysundell.com/2021/uikits-new-button-configuration-api) has a first look at how to use the new button configuration API.
Alternatively, [Sarun Wongpatcharapakornand](https://twitter.com/sarunw) has written an [article](https://sarunw.com/posts/new-way-to-style-uibutton-in-ios15) claiming that, with `UIButton.Configuration`, we are not obligated to subclass `UIButton` anymore.

### Core Data with `NSInMemoryStoreType`

In the [article](https://useyourloaf.com/blog/core-data-in-memory-store) by [Keith Harrison](https://twitter.com/kharrison), you can find out how to speed up your tests and `SwiftUI` previews by creating a `Core Data` stack with an in-memory store.

### Notifying users of application updates

What percentage of your userbase is on the latest version of the application you are working on? [Andy Ibanez](https://twitter.com/AndyIbanezK) claims that users may not be updating as often as you believe and shares his solution to let them know a new version is available without being invasive in an [article](https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/quick-tip-notifying-users-app-updates-for-free).

### Why should you care about manual testing?

[Tom√°≈° ≈†ur√≠n](https://twitter.com/tomassurin) gives his perspective on manual testing as another tool that, when put to good use, can improve product quality significantly in his [article](https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2021/pragmatic-manual-testing).

### A first look at `AttributedString`

[John Sundell](https://twitter.com/johnsundell) has written an [article](https://wwdcbysundell.com/2021/a-first-look-at-attributed-string) comparing `NSAttributedString` and `AttributedString` implementation and new type's integration with `SwiftUI`. Spoiler, `AttributedString` has built-in Markdown (lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor) support.
Additionally, take a look at the [article](https://betterprogramming.pub/ios-15-attributed-strings-in-swiftui-markdown-271204bec5c1) by [Andrew Zheng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aheze) where he supplies multiple examples on working with `AttributedString`.

### Avoiding problematic cases when using enumerations

[John Sundell](https://twitter.com/johnsundell) wrote an [article](https://swiftbysundell.com/articles/avoiding-problematic-enum-cases-in-swift) warning about certain `enum` cases that can arguably be good to avoid.

### Modern `RxSwift` architectures

In an [article](https://academy.realm.io/posts/try-swift-nyc-2017-krunoslav-zaher-modern-rxswift-architectures), [Krunoslav Zaher](https://twitter.com/KrunoslavZaher) shares his experience solving cycling data dependencies with `RxFeedback` architecture.

## Tips

### `defer` in Swift

[Vincent Pradeilles](https://twitter.com/v_pradeilles) in his YouTube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VswqQqVlHo) offers an exemplary use case for `defer` keyword.

### Confusing Swift syntaxes

[Vincent Pradeilles](https://twitter.com/v_pradeilles) created a YouTube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3qdi6KyzDk) to underscore multiple valid but counter-intuitive Swift syntaxes that you too, most likely, have never come across before.

### Custom `UIStackView` spacing

Twitter [post](https://twitter.com/sarunw/status/1403516739615404041) by [Sarun Wongpatcharapakornand](https://twitter.com/sarunw) calls to our attention that to apply custom spacing between arranged subviews there hasn't been the need to add additional  `UIStackView` as arranged subview since iOS 11 which extended `UIStackView` with `setCustomSpacing(_:after:)` instance method.
Additionally, read an [article](https://sarunw.com/posts/custom-uistackview-spacing) where he features few caveats.

### `UIKit` asynchronous image decoding

I was delighted to read a Twitter [post](https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/1401997686102970369) by [Marco Arment](https://twitter.com/marcoarment) in which he shared with his find ‚Äî native asynchronous image decoding and creation of image thumbnails.
